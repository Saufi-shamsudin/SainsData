    I purchased this item based on the financing offer of 12 months compared to the 2011 models that are only for 6 months. It is easier to pay off, and I compared the new model to this 2.66 version which loads just as fast as the 2011 level. It is also 350GB space like the 2011 version and the 2.66GHZ speed is great! Even if the new model has Intel 5, it doesn't really matter because the 2011 macbook has a sucky-sucky graphics card compared to the great Nvidia which has crisp bright colors that are just breathtaking! Yes It only has one processor but I am absolutely amazed how fast this laptop is. You have to see it for yourself and video editing is so easy and so smooth! Well Of course all Macbooks are made in the premium line of laptops and this was a great purchase for me! Way lower price and great deal on amazon + great financing offer + discount promotion! = Happy Customer!

    I still own this bought a while ago. Apple makes durable products so there's that and it is a great laptop unlike many windows products that can drive you insane. Don't worry about a learning curve switching to apple. There is really none unless you are so behind in technology that you need help. If so their customer support needs work. I never needed them so that's what you get with apple good product so you don't need their hopelessly pathetic geniuses or call center.

    It only took 3 years to find out that my MacBook was sent to me with a broken logic board! Good thing I didn’t have anything important on it when it decided to crash time after time. Even when I went to get it fixed, it would get misdiagnosed as either hard drive or RAM issues. I should have just bought a new one

    I've had my MacBook Pro for about six weeks, and I think it's great.  I love the size.  I'm still learning how to function efficiently, since I was a long time PC user.  I'll never go back to a PC.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of any type of word processor, so now I have to purchase one.  I did have to call customer service once (for something stupid actually:) and I was thrilled to talk to an english speaking agent!  I'd give this product  a very enthusiastic two thumbs up!

    While I am happy about receiving my first macbook pro, I am not happy about the fact that the body of this item did not match what was stated. the seller said their wasn't any body scratches which was NOT the truth. This owner also did not mention the dent on the outer casing of my macbook pro as well as the layer of plastic that is peeling off around the keyboard. I am grateful for this deal, I just wish the seller told absolute truth so when I looked at it, I wasn't disappointed. Overall this laptop is working great!

    I purchased this laptop to do mostly audio editing and it preforms wonderfully. and has yet to fail me. Comparing it to my old windows laptop there really is no comparison except maybe the face my old laptop was a bb gun and this mac is a cruise missile. work's beautifully. amazon's ad was perfect it came with a scratch on the under cover but nothing noticeable unless you got right up to it. and with a case over it now you'd never know it was there. Other wise everything came as they said it would and works.

    I've had my MacBook Pro for about six weeks, and I think it's great.  I love the size.  I'm still learning how to function efficiently, since I was a long time PC user.  I'll never go back to a PC.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of any type of word processor, so now I have to purchase one.  I did have to call customer service once (for something stupid actually:) and I was thrilled to talk to an english speaking agent!  I'd give this product  a very enthusiastic two thumbs up!

    While I am happy about receiving my first macbook pro, I am not happy about the fact that the body of this item did not match what was stated. the seller said their wasn't any body scratches which was NOT the truth. This owner also did not mention the dent on the outer casing of my macbook pro as well as the layer of plastic that is peeling off around the keyboard. I am grateful for this deal, I just wish the seller told absolute truth so when I looked at it, I wasn't disappointed. Overall this laptop is working great!

    I purchased this laptop to do mostly audio editing and it preforms wonderfully. and has yet to fail me. Comparing it to my old windows laptop there really is no comparison except maybe the face my old laptop was a bb gun and this mac is a cruise missile. work's beautifully. amazon's ad was perfect it came with a scratch on the under cover but nothing noticeable unless you got right up to it. and with a case over it now you'd never know it was there. Other wise everything came as they said it would and works.

    I purchased this item based on the financing offer of 12 months compared to the 2011 models that are only for 6 months. It is easier to pay off, and I compared the new model to this 2.66 version which loads just as fast as the 2011 level. It is also 350GB space like the 2011 version and the 2.66GHZ speed is great! Even if the new model has Intel 5, it doesn't really matter because the 2011 macbook has a sucky-sucky graphics card compared to the great Nvidia which has crisp bright colors that are just breathtaking! Yes It only has one processor but I am absolutely amazed how fast this laptop is. You have to see it for yourself and video editing is so easy and so smooth! Well Of course all Macbooks are made in the premium line of laptops and this was a great purchase for me! Way lower price and great deal on amazon + great financing offer + discount promotion! = Happy Customer!

    I still own this bought a while ago. Apple makes durable products so there's that and it is a great laptop unlike many windows products that can drive you insane. Don't worry about a learning curve switching to apple. There is really none unless you are so behind in technology that you need help. If so their customer support needs work. I never needed them so that's what you get with apple good product so you don't need their hopelessly pathetic geniuses or call center.

    It only took 3 years to find out that my MacBook was sent to me with a broken logic board! Good thing I didn’t have anything important on it when it decided to crash time after time. Even when I went to get it fixed, it would get misdiagnosed as either hard drive or RAM issues. I should have just bought a new one

    I bought this and other Macbook Pros .. they are all great machines. I hardly ever have to reboot, free software updates these days. Interface takes getting used to but once you get used to it, there's no going back to Windows.

    I purchased this laptop to do mostly audio editing and it preforms wonderfully. and has yet to fail me. Comparing it to my old windows laptop there really is no comparison except maybe the face my old laptop was a bb gun and this mac is a cruise missile. work's beautifully. amazon's ad was perfect it came with a scratch on the under cover but nothing noticeable unless you got right up to it. and with a case over it now you'd never know it was there. Other wise everything came as they said it would and works.

    I purchased this item based on the financing offer of 12 months compared to the 2011 models that are only for 6 months. It is easier to pay off, and I compared the new model to this 2.66 version which loads just as fast as the 2011 level. It is also 350GB space like the 2011 version and the 2.66GHZ speed is great! Even if the new model has Intel 5, it doesn't really matter because the 2011 macbook has a sucky-sucky graphics card compared to the great Nvidia which has crisp bright colors that are just breathtaking! Yes It only has one processor but I am absolutely amazed how fast this laptop is. You have to see it for yourself and video editing is so easy and so smooth! Well Of course all Macbooks are made in the premium line of laptops and this was a great purchase for me! Way lower price and great deal on amazon + great financing offer + discount promotion! = Happy Customer!

    I still own this bought a while ago. Apple makes durable products so there's that and it is a great laptop unlike many windows products that can drive you insane. Don't worry about a learning curve switching to apple. There is really none unless you are so behind in technology that you need help. If so their customer support needs work. I never needed them so that's what you get with apple good product so you don't need their hopelessly pathetic geniuses or call center.

    It only took 3 years to find out that my MacBook was sent to me with a broken logic board! Good thing I didn’t have anything important on it when it decided to crash time after time. Even when I went to get it fixed, it would get misdiagnosed as either hard drive or RAM issues. I should have just bought a new one

    I've had my MacBook Pro for about six weeks, and I think it's great.  I love the size.  I'm still learning how to function efficiently, since I was a long time PC user.  I'll never go back to a PC.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of any type of word processor, so now I have to purchase one.  I did have to call customer service once (for something stupid actually:) and I was thrilled to talk to an english speaking agent!  I'd give this product  a very enthusiastic two thumbs up!

    While I am happy about receiving my first macbook pro, I am not happy about the fact that the body of this item did not match what was stated. the seller said their wasn't any body scratches which was NOT the truth. This owner also did not mention the dent on the outer casing of my macbook pro as well as the layer of plastic that is peeling off around the keyboard. I am grateful for this deal, I just wish the seller told absolute truth so when I looked at it, I wasn't disappointed. Overall this laptop is working great!

Well Of course all Macbooks are made in the premium line of laptops and this was a great purchase for me! Way lower price and great deal on amazon + great financing offer + discount promotion! = Happy Customer!

    I still own this bought a while ago. Apple makes durable products so there's that and it is a great laptop unlike many windows products that can drive you insane. Don't worry about a learning curve switching to apple. There is really none unless you are so behind in technology that you need help. If so their customer support needs work. I never needed them so that's what you get with apple good product so you don't need their hopelessly pathetic geniuses or call center.

    It only took 3 years to find out that my MacBook was sent to me with a broken logic board! Good thing I didn’t have anything important on it when it decided to crash time after time. Even when I went to get it fixed, it would get misdiagnosed as either hard drive or RAM issues. I should have just bought a new one

    Broke within six weeks from a problem that was probably previously known.

    I've had my MacBook Pro for about six weeks, and I think it's great.  I love the size.  I'm still learning how to function efficiently, since I was a long time PC user.  I'll never go back to a PC.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of any type of word processor, so now I have to purchase one.  I did have to call customer service once (for something stupid actually:) and I was thrilled to talk to an english speaking agent!  I'd give this product  a very enthusiastic two thumbs up!

    While I am happy about receiving my first macbook pro, I am not happy about the fact that the body of this item did not match what was stated. the seller said their wasn't any body scratches which was NOT the truth. This owner also did not mention the dent on the outer casing of my macbook pro as well as the layer of plastic that is peeling off around the keyboard. I am grateful for this deal, I just wish the seller told absolute truth so when I looked at it, I wasn't disappointed. Overall this laptop is working great!

    Love apple products. I purchased used with high hopes of the \"included\" additional software, seller was unable to provide it after fresh install. The magsafe charger works but i poor condition.

    I bought this and other Macbook Pros .. they are all great machines. I hardly ever have to reboot, free software updates these days. Interface takes getting used to but once you get used to it, there's no going back to Windows.

    I purchased this laptop to do mostly audio editing and it preforms wonderfully. and has yet to fail me. Comparing it to my old windows laptop there really is no comparison except maybe the face my old laptop was a bb gun and this mac is a cruise missile. work's beautifully. amazon's ad was perfect it came with a scratch on the under cover but nothing noticeable unless you got right up to it. and with a case over it now you'd never know it was there. Other wise everything came as they said it would and works.
