Its ridiculous that we are forced to use any carrier in order to buy this phone   Cricket carrier? Um, no. Same price unlocked at Apple. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone! I always loved the old body style of the iPhone 4 and the size of the newer ones and now I get the best of both worlds, old Body style with a larger screen! I love the way it feels in my hand and I love how crystal clear everything looks. By far my favorite version of the iPhone. Well done Apple!I’m a cricket customer, how can I buy it without the subscription? I want to buy this phone from you but I already have my family and I using cricket, however, I’m not managing in take of the subscription. I don’t want to have another cricket number if I already have one.This is a Cricket Locked iPhone - It Says So in the Title!Firstly and foremost, this iPhone 12 Pro Max is locked to Cricket Wireless. It says so in the title of the product. *Literally* in the title of the product. Everyone complaining that this phone is locked to Cricket simply does not know how to read.A lot of iPhone 12 pro users (myself included) are having a problem with the cell service dropping for no reason. My opinion is to delay a purchase until there is a fix for this problem.Getting used to no home button is the only thing taking me awhile to get used to Love the display.This brand New iPhone 12 Pro Mac 512GB SUPPOSEDLY LOCKED TO CRICKET WIRELESS I WAS FORCED TO HAVE TO RETURN THIS DEVICE BACK TO AMAZON 1.  THIS DEVICE WOUKD NOT ACTIVATE UNDER THE CRICKET WIRELESS SUBSCRIPTION THAT AMAZON.com HAS SOLD TO ME 2. CRICKEY WIRELESS REFUSED TO PUT CRICKET WIRELESS HAND PROTECTION ON THIS DEVICE DUE TO THEM TELLING ME THAT THIS DEVICE WAS A BYOD DEVICE IN WHICH MEANS THAT THIS DEVICE THAT I WAS FORCED TO RETURN BACK TO AMAZON SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNLOCKED BUT IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED. IT WAS LOCKED TO A MYSTERIOUS  CARRIER. THEN I CALLED APPLE INC ABOUT THIS DEVICE AND WITH THEIR WONDERFUL PRIVACY AGREEMENT THAT THEY SO SUBCONSCIOUSLY HAVE WITH ME BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT TODAY DEVICE BELONGED TO SOME INDIVIDUALS NAME AND IT WAS NOT OENED BY AMAZON.com. SO BUYER BEWARE THIS IS IF YOU ARE EVEN TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE LOCKED DEVICES BY CRICKET WIRELESS Whats up Apple
his is the cheapest IPhone i have had by far. IPhone 12 pro max, brand new and a scratch on the screen. This is the second one. Apple using the cheapest glass and want you to pay top dollar for it. Just goes to show you they don't care at all about customer happiness, just their money. Got my phone after 3 days when it finally was released and Im very much happy with what i got
I hate this phone! I last purchased the iPhone 7 Plus. It just feels funny like a slick eel or something. I miss the control button at the bottom compared to the iPhone 7plus. The length and view of the phone was extended but it did nothing for the phone. I don’t see the difference in photos yet either. The color of the phone is not that great either, and unlike in the picture. I am simply not impressed! Shame on Apple for releasing before they worked out the bugs. Disgusting.  And Tana? Chip? No one seems to bother to even acknowledge a massive returns and compliance worldwide that it drops calls within 30 seconds to 2 minutes and sometimes the speaker works and sometimes it doesn’t. I spent every day for three weeks troubleshooting every possible way and nothing fixed it. Look at the forum read the other reviews again this is everyone all models and worldwide. And now you can’t buy the 11s anymore from Apple because it was the last model?!! Well I found it at Best Buy and you can get AppleCare and the phone is perfect. Apple put me in a really bad situation where I was switching over numbers and had to go back to my back up phone and had no time to even transition the number that I was going to switch from. The whole thing has just been a disaster thank God I returned both of them within the two week period. They finally told me I’m better off returning and not trying to set up a third phone. I think I would’ve lost my mind doing it three times & returning three times! People in line with me we’re taking theirs back but everyone acts like they are surprised when you mention issues. Apple Support will tell you they have no idea what you’re talking about it’s unbelievable!  Check Google! Check the Apple forum! Very sorry for those of you who did not! One tec said when the S versions come out about a year later they usually work out the bugs. I am more than annoyed at the time and money I’ve put into this phone. Don’t buy it yet!!!!!! Thank you all for your feedback. I thought the camera is impressive but for all other reasons (noted in the reviews) I am not buying this product anymore. I almost did. Bro Please Make This Phone Fully Unlocked!!!!!! PLEASE!! It is easy to by No one uses cricket carrier. Make it unlocked Let me listen at my own volume
